## 📋 Naming Conventions

### Directory Structure
- **Weekly directories**: `WEEK-<week_number>-<topic1>-<topic2>`
- **Daily directories**: `DAY-<day_number>-<question1>-<question2>`
- **Problem files**: `<question_number>_<questionName>.cpp`

### Examples
- `WEEK-01-Arrays-Hashings/` - Week 1 covering Arrays and Hashings
- `DAY-01-TWO_SUM-CONTAINS_DUPLICATES/` - Day 1 with Two Sum and Contains Duplicates problems
- `01_TwoSum.cpp` - First problem: Two Sum

## 📝 Problem Documentation Standards

Each problem file follows a consistent structure:

### 1. Problem Statement

## 💡 Learning Approach

### For Each Problem:
1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the problem statement carefully
2. **Plan Your Approach**: Think about different solutions
3. **Analyze Complexity**: Consider time and space complexity
4. **Implement**: Write clean, well-documented code
5. **Test**: Verify with multiple test cases
6. **Optimize**: Look for better solutions

### Best Practices:
- Always consider edge cases
- Document your thought process
- Include multiple approaches when possible
- Test with various input sizes
- Follow consistent coding style

## 🔧 Code Style Guidelines

### C++ Standards
- Use meaningful variable names
- Include proper header files
- Add comprehensive comments
- Follow consistent indentation
- Use `using namespace std;` for simplicity in practice

### File Structure
```cpp
/*
Problem Statement
*/

/*
APPROACH
1. Approach 1
   - Description
   - Time Complexity: O(...)
   - Space Complexity: O(...)

2. Approach 2
   - Description
   - Time Complexity: O(...)
   - Space Complexity: O(...)
*/

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
// ... other includes
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    // Solution method
};

int main() {
    // Test cases
    return 0;
}
```
